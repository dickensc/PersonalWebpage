Welcome to my webpage! I am Charles, a PhD Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of California Santa Cruz. I am a new member of the [LINQS](https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/home) lab where I will be working on some super exciting research in statistical relational learning and probabilistic soft logic. I am passionate about the field of machine learning and in particular inference in graphical models, learning with limited data, and interpretable machine learning.
