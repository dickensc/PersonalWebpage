Welcome to my webpage! I am Charles, a Ph.D. computer science and engineering candidate at the University of California Santa Cruz.
My general research interests are in machine learning, modeling richly structured graph data, and empowering AI with domain knowledge and symbolic reasoning capabilities.
I have developed models for a variety of applications, including computer vision, language modeling, social networks, demand forecasting, and recommendation.
I am seeking a research engineer role where I can contribute my skills to produce impactful research and products.
