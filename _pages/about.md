Welcome to my webpage! I am Charles, a PhD Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of California Santa Cruz working as a member of the [LINQS](https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/home) lab.
My research interests are generally in machine learning and graphical models.
I am particularly interested in improving the scalability, performance, and robustness of structured prediction algorithms using modern ideas from optimization.
I am excited to work on applications related to fair machine learning and online settings.
